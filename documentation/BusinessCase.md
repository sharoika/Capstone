## Proposed Project
**Project Name:**  
Fleet

**Date Produced:**  
October 14, 2024

## Background
The biggest problem in the ride-sharing market is the current monopoly that Uber has formed. A monopoly is not good for either the rider or driver as it lets Uber have 100% control over the prices. This leads to 3 key issues:

1. **Ethical**:  
   Uber controls prices; using an AI algorithm, it attempts to maximize prices to riders while minimizing payment to drivers. Thus, riders never know how much the drivers earn. It also uses this ambiguity to take an unknown cut of the drivers and riders' fares.

2. **Legal**:  
   A legal contractor in the USA and Canada must be able to set their rates. Uber does not allow that yet considers drivers contractors. They are currently in litigation in multiple states regarding this issue.

3. **Transparency**:  
   Uber hides its algorithm, leaving many drivers feeling confused about how rates work and why they might get a lower rate compared to other drivers. Uber also marks some of their rides as environmentally friendly for a higher rate but it doesnâ€™t specify why or how this is a form of greenwashing.

## Business Need/Opportunity
Fleet will allow the driver to set their own rate while driving for longer or shorter distances. It will allow the driver to receive at least 95% of the fare while Fleet only keeps what it needs to facilitate the rides. Customers know they are getting a more ethical solution where the driver is making the majority of the fare price. Finally, customers will have the opportunity to request a desired driver, allowing them to create relationships for long-term service.

## Options
Create a ride-sharing mobile application that can be on both iOS and Android. We would use the MERN-M tech stack in accordance with REST standards due to its features and the experience our team has with the stack. This will be a mobile application; React Native allows for both iOS and Android compatibility.

## Cost-Benefit Analysis
**Option 1:**  
Developing a ride-sharing application where the users get control of setting their fare price while also providing a high level of service will allow for a more satisfying experience for both customers and drivers. It will incentivize drivers due to the competitive 5% commission that Fleet will take, as opposed to the minimum 30% Uber takes per ride, while also delivering quality service. On the contrary, competing with a monopoly is extremely difficult. Our base logic is similar in ridesharing, but we differ where we allow drivers to be true contractors in setting their own prices as opposed to being given one by a monopolistic company.

## Recommendation
We will focus on **MVP 1**, which is a working backend with a skeleton frontend, and aim to finish it by the end of January. Once **MVP 1** is complete, we aim to finish **MVP 2** by the end of February, which is a finished frontend with user testing once complete we will submit it to the AppStone and AndroidStore. Finally, for **MVP 3**, we will aim to **publish** the application on both iOS and Android stores, allowing for public access to the application.
