# User Testing

User testing is a crucial phase of our development process, and we plan to conduct it once we have completed our Minimum Viable Product (MVP 1). 

Currently, the project is still in development, and our focus remains on building core functionalities to deliver a reliable and functional first iteration. User testing will involve gathering feedback from real users to identify potential improvements, validate our design and feature decisions, and ensure the overall usability of the product. This iterative feedback loop will help refine the application to meet user needs effectively.
