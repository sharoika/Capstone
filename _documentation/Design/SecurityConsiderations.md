# Security Considerations

This document outlines the security measures implemented in our application.

## Authentication Tokens

- **JWT Implementation**: Our application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless authentication.
- **Token Expiration**: All tokens have a defined expiration time to limit the window of opportunity for attacks.
- **Token Revocation**: Mechanisms are in place to invalidate tokens when users log out or change passwords.

## MongoDB Security

- **Authentication**: MongoDB instances require authentication with strong username/password combinations.
- **TLS/SSL**: All connections to MongoDB use TLS/SSL encryption to secure data in transit.
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data fields are encrypted at rest within MongoDB collections.
- **Regular Updates**: Database servers are kept updated with the latest security patches.
- **Sanitized Queries**: All database queries are parameterized to prevent NoSQL injection attacks.

## HTTPS Implementation

- **TLS/SSL Certificates**: Valid certificates from trusted Certificate Authorities are implemented across all endpoints.
- **HTTP to HTTPS Redirection**: All HTTP requests are automatically redirected to HTTPS.
- **HSTS**: HTTP Strict Transport Security headers are implemented to prevent downgrade attacks.
- **Certificate Monitoring**: Certificates are monitored for expiration and automatically renewed.

## Digital Ocean Security

- **Firewalls**: DigitalOcean Cloud Firewalls are configured to restrict access to only necessary ports and services.
- **IAM**: Identity and Access Management controls are implemented to limit access to cloud resources.
- **Security Updates**: All systems receive automatic security updates.

## Payment Security

- **Stripe Integration**: All payment processing is handled by Stripe, a PCI-DSS compliant provider.
- **No Card Data Storage**: Our application never stores, processes, or transmits actual credit card data.
- **Tokenization**: We only store tokenized references (Stripe IDs) to customers and payment methods.
- **Secure API Keys**: Stripe API keys are securely stored as environment variables, never in code repositories.
- **Audit Logging**: All payment-related actions are logged for audit purposes without sensitive data.

## General Security Practices

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
- **Output Encoding**: Data is properly encoded before being returned to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
- **Regular Security Audits**: The application undergoes regular security reviews and penetration testing.
- **Dependency Management**: Dependencies are regularly updated and scanned for known vulnerabilities.
- **Secure Development Practices**: The development team follows secure coding guidelines and reviews. 
- **Location Security**: All of our location tracking is handled by the native location services.
